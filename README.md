In post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, players embark on a journey to reach a safe haven while navigating through various challenges all while clinging to the hope of a cure for the undead. The ultimate goal? Reach the safe haven with minimal casualties, showcasing compassion and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. Players earn points by successfully navigating through scenes without resorting to violence, helping fellow survivors, and making choices that align with the goal of minimizing harm. Points are deducted for actions that escalate conflicts unnecessarily. To win the game, players must accumulate a certain number of points by demonstrating empathy, and strategic thinking. Every player begins with 15 points; however, if players accumulate too many negative points by making harmful decisions, they risk losing the game.
