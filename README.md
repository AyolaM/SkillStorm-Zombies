
Save The Zombies. In post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, players embark on a journey to reach a safe haven while navigating through various challenges all while clinging to the hope of an impending cure for the undead plague. Throughout the game, players must make strategic decisions that impact their survival and the well-being of others. The primary objective is to reach the safe haven with as few casualties as possible, emphasizing the importance of compassion and resourcefulness amidst the chaos. Players earn points by successfully navigating through scenes without resorting to violence, helping fellow survivors, and making choices that align with the goal of minimizing harm. Conversely, points are deducted for actions that result in harm to others or escalate conflicts unnecessarily. To win the game, players must accumulate a certain number of points by demonstrating empathy, teamwork, and strategic thinking. However, if players accumulate too many negative points by making harmful decisions, they risk losing the game.
